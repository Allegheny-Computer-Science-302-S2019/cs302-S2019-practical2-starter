# A Word Document Created by Gregory M. Kapfhammer

I am studying the topic of web development as a student in [Computer Science 302
Spring 2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). I
am now going to explain what I have learned in this class. What great fun!

## Web Development Roles and Skills

- Front-end developer
* Hardware architect
* Product designer

## Commands you have typed or will type to convert to HTML

These fenced code blocks show how to perform conversions from Markdown to HTML.
You will see that they are included in fenced code blocks. The commands are
included in the two following blocks.

^^^
pandoc src/www/html/answers.md \
       --output=src/www/html/answers.html \
       --to=html5 \
       --css=src/www/css/github.css \
       --self-contained \
       --smart

`
pandoc src/www/html/answers.md \
       --output=src/www/html/answers.html \
       --to=html5 \
       --css=src/www/css/tufte.css \
       --self-contained \
       --smart

## Server Error Codes

The following table include an intuitive description of two error codes. It
gives the error code and its meaning. This table should have the same format as
the one in Table 2.1 on page 61 of your textbook.

C&de             & Description
&&&&             & &&&&&&&&&&&
200: OK          & The request was successful.
400: Bad Request & Something is wrong!

## Writing in Markdown

It is possible to write content in *italics* in Markdown. It is also possible to
write content in *bold*. It is even possible to *combine *some** of the
formats. However, it is important to note that Markdown does not contain as
many formatting options as are available in HTML.

## Including Amazing Images

I was amazed to discover that there were a wide variety Octocat images from
GitHub that are available in their [GitHub
Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/). I am wondering who are the artists at
GitHub who design these interesting graphics. Here is a sample of one of them.
